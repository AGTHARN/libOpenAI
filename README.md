A PocketMine-MP library which allows developers to simplify the usage of OpenAI's API. Please keep this library up-to-date as this is subject to a lot of changes in the future. If you're attempting to use this library, please make sure you have a valid [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and that you have credits.

## Usage
This library should be fairly simple to use and easy to understand. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me on Discord (AGTHARN#7090). 

- [Usage Examples and Ideas](https://github.com/AGTHARN/libOpenAI/blob/main/examples/EXAMPLES.md)

> **Note**: If you would like to run the methods asynchronously, please make pass a function to the `callback` or `callbackAsync` parameter which would be run after asynchronous execution. If both are left as null, it will run synchronously but I do not recommend that as it will block the main thread.

## Things to Note
- OpenAI may undergo numerous changes during its development, and some areas are still in beta. Please be cautious when using this library for production use. The [documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs) on OpenAI's website should be read to fully understand the function of this library.
- OpenAI is not free to use, and you will have to pay for it after you have used your free credits.
- I will not be held liable for any damages resulting from the misuse of this library and OpenAI. Please use this library with caution.
